stm32lib/*
  - all the (possibly consolidated) stm32 lib and usb example code

  - main loop and calling any hardware init stuff. timing hacks for EEPROM
    writes not to block usb interrupts. logic to handle 2 second timeout then
    jump to user code.

  - init routines to setup clocks, interrupts, also destructor functions.
    does not include USB stuff. EEPROM read/write functions.
